        <h2>What is Alt Ctrl Org and Track 4</h2>
        <p>wordcamp EU has 3 tracks in the day, but we’re here to introduce <strong>Track 4</strong>, the evening track that is an alternative space for ideas that might not fit the official program. Alt Ctrl Org is the physicl space where people can meet, talk and think outside the box.</p>
        <p>In this informal setting (yes, a bar!), we’re bringing together speakers for quick, impactful talks on topics like governance, freedom of expression, decentralization, and other challenging issues. Drinks in hand we will have talks about organising alternative paths for a alternative unified future.</p>

        <h2>Secret Location, Exciting Vibes</h2>

Anonymity for attendees is a priority your identity will not be published and will remain private by default unless you choose to engage more publicly during the event.</p>
        <h2>Free Entry, Big Impact</h2>
        <p>Alt Ctrl Org is free to attend, but small donations are welcome. Any remaining sponsorship or entey funds will be evenly distributed to our speakers on the night, ensuring their contributions are supported.
