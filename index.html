        <h1 style="text-align: center;">AltControl: Track 4 – The W6P EU sideloading Party</h1>
        <p>Join us on <strong>Saturday, June 7th</strong>, in Basel for a bold, addition to the W6P EU experience. Welcome to <strong>AltControl: Track 4</strong> – the track that wasn’t invited, but might just offer a new perspective on where things are heading.</p>

        <h2>What’s AltControl: Track 4?</h2>
        <p>W6P EU has <strong>three tracks</strong>—but we’re here to introduce <strong>Track 4</strong>, the alternative space for ideas that might not fit the official program. AltControl is a playful nod to the talks that won’t be heard on the main stage, but are essential to rethinking the future of the <strong>W7S project</strong>.</p>
        <p>In this informal setting (yes, <strong>a bar!</strong>), we’re bringing together speakers for quick, impactful talks on topics like <strong>governance, freedom of expression, decentralization</strong>, and other issues that challenge the current direction of the web. Drinks in hand, <strong>raw talks </strong> about alternative paths for <strong>W7S</strong> and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Secret Location, Exclusive Vibes</h2>
        <p>To keep the atmosphere laid-back and <strong>free from interference</strong>, the venue will be kept secret until the last moment. You’ll get the details by email just before the event. <strong>Anonymity for attendees</strong> is a priority—your identity will remain private by default unless you choose to engage more publicly during the event.</p>

        <h2>Free Entry, Big Impact</h2>
        <p>AltControl is <strong>free to attend</strong>, but donations are welcome. Any remaining sponsorship funds will be <strong>evenly distributed to our speakers</strong>, ensuring their contributions are supported. At the event, participants will also vote on which foundation or cause will receive the <strong>AltControl brand, logo, and IP</strong>—helping the legacy of this event support something meaningful.</p>

        <h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>
        <p>AltControl thrives on community support, and we're looking for <strong>sponsors</strong> to help bring this event to life. By sponsoring, you’ll help create a space where new ideas about <strong>W7S governance</strong> and control can flourish, while also supporting the voices of our speakers.</p>
