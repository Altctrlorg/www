I set this up for the love of WordPress, WordCamps, the meet ups, and the community and experiences they all bring.

I donâ€™t like seeing people silenced, misled, or having too much power concentrated in one place.

I believed my volunteering was supporting a foundation, not a personal or corporate product, so I feel a bit misled.

I want people to continue attending WordCamps but also participate in these events. Ideally, every WordCamp could include an Alt Ctrl Org meet up with its own governance.

By June, the aim is to have an independent governance model ready for community voting, creating a pathway for shared leadership. Until then, efforts will focus on building connections, organizing a group, and laying the groundwork for an open, inclusive, and community-driven WordPress space.
