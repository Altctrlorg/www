Alt Ctrl Org was founded out of a deep love for WordPress, WordPress meet ups, and the vibrant community that comes with the software. The mission is to celebrate and champion the openness, collaboration, and inclusivity that make this ecosystem so remarkable.

The goal is to empower all voices within the WordPress community. Alt Ctrl Org envisions a space where everyone can contribute equally, fostering an environment where diverse and interesting perspectives are heard. Imagine a future where WordCamps continue to thrive, each featuring an Alt Ctrl Org meet up that invites fresh ideas with community-led schedules.

By June, the aim is to have an independent governance model ready for community voting, creating a pathway for shared leadership. Until then, efforts will focus on building connections, organizing a group, and laying the groundwork for an open, inclusive, and community-driven WordPress space.

For the love of WordPress
