As you can probably tell I have no idea what I am doing, so why not come and help us!

I set this up because I love wordpress, wordpress meetups, and the community and experiences they bring.

I donâ€™t like seeing people silenced, misled, or having too much power concentrated in one place.

I believed my volunteering was supporting a foundation, not a personal or corporate product, so I feel a bit misled.

I want people to continue attending WordCamps but also participate in these events. Ideally, every WordCamp could include an Alt Ctrl Org meetup with its own governance.

By June, I hope there will be an independent governance initiative in place that we can vote on to transfer control to on the night. Until then, we will bring people together and set up a group, to seek to oraganise alternative controls.
